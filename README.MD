# Clearance_Item_Finder

Clearance_Item_Finder is a Spring-based JSON API written in Java that gets and stores clearance items from various 
retailers RESTful APIs. The data is stored into a MySQL database and periodically updated.

Please note: This API is in active development.

##Motivation
I get much satisfaction at finding bargain deals. I use [Slickdeals](https://slickdeals.net/)  in conjuction with
[Brickseek](https://brickseek.com/) to find and locate these deals but it is a lot of perusing. I want to create an app that 
does the initial search for clearance items for me and categorizing those deals. 

##Things to implement
* Database storage and updating of pricing of items
* Categorize database items
* Percent Discount Indicator
* Item Location Finder
* Incorporate more retailers
